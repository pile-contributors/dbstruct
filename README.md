DbStruct
========

This pile contains classes that can be used to
describe the structure of a database.

The idea derives from a [CodeProject article](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/76814/Generate-SQL-Database-Schema-from-XML-Part-File)
that features a way to *Generate SQL Database Schema from XML*.

The code that is capable to generate an in-memory
representation using structures defined by this pile
from various sources is grouped in another pile: []().

The code that exports the structure to various other formats
is grouped in yet another pile: []().
